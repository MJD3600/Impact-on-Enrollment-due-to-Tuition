# Impact-on-Enrollment-due-to-Tuition

For my Final Exam in my Methodogly of Data Science class we were tasked to solve a problem or find a correlation from data. After many diffrent topics I decided to write on the Impact on Enrollment due to Tutition in colleges across the United States. For my data I found data that was correlated towards Public in State, Public out of state and Private colleges. The time line for the data was over the last 20 years to ensure I had enough data to show real trends within the data. I was able to web scrape data including changes in enrollment, Tuition, admission, admission rate, and admission to enrollment ratio. Using Beautiful Soup, I was able to parser the html data and then finding the certain table within the html code that I wanted to pull the data. After that I converted the tables into an appended data frame that was converted to a CSV file making it easier to plot using MatPlot lib. I hace included my CSV files that inlcude the scraped data, the python code file, and the PDF file of my final report that I presented to my Professors.
